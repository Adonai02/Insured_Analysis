# Insured\_Analysis

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of Insured\_Analysis is to â€¦

<!--What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:-->
<!--You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.-->
<!--You can also embed plots, for example:-->
